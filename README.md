That's my second full project done in order to learn Full Stack Web Development from The Odin Project. In this one, I was able to apply all my knowledge in HTML and CSS acquired through the course. By doing it, I could learn:

* How a HTML file organize its tags;
* The differences between blocks an inlines;
* CSS Flexbox;
* Flexbox properties - growing,shrinking, axes, alignment;
* How to style a webpage with CSS;
* Build a full functional webpage <b>from the scratch<b>.
